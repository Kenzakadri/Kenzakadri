# Hi there üëã

## I am a final year **PhD student** in **Computational neuroscience** fascinated about the brain üß† at different scales. 

I am working on the ‚ú®neural substrates of decision-making and addiction‚ú® in the [Fouragnan lab](https://www.elsa-fouragnan.com/). 

## What I am doing üå±
- I linked precise striatum subdivisions to behavioural measure of addiction using **Machine Learning** on rs-fMRI from the [Human Conectome Project](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/data-releases) database
-  I also study the link between credit-assignment impairment and substance uses on a big dataset through the application of **reinforcement learning models** and **machine learning** to explain aspects of Alcohol addiction.

## What I did üëµ
- I modeled the cortico-pulvino-cortical network in cats to confirm the role of the pulvinar in the synchronization of the area 17 and 21a from animal data. To do so, I used an _adaptative exponential integrate-and-fire model_.
- During my master in **system biology** I had the opportunity to analyse genomic and transcriptomic data (What are the genes implied in osteosarcoma, and how did they connect togeter?), behavioural data (why are we left or right handed üëå). From single and multi-layers neural networks (‚≠ê ‚ú®) to complex system (how to model the glucose level in a diabetic mouse model).

## Fun fact
- I wear sunglasses inside because I am visually impaired... or maybe it's because I am just ‚ú®French‚ú® üòé
- I love to put logos everywhere (as you can see)
